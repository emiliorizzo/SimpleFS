# About

This is a tribute to Ángel "Java" López, a prolific software developer from Argentina with whom we had the pleasure of working with.

We believe that Angel would have liked memories of his work and creations to be captured in blockchains, a technology that was the focus of his last years of work and also to which he dedicated much of his hobby time. We found a work in progress project in his [Github account](https://github.com/ajlopez/) that implemented a simple system to store files on a smart contract blockchain.
He was experimenting with this code to upload images of his watercolor paintings to the RSK testnet. We used all his code to store his paintings on the mainnets of RSK and Ethereum.

We respected his design to upload files as chunks to individual smart contracts and we used all his Javascript code to call contracts and get the images. The only modification we did was to remove a server side component he made and do it as an all client side dapp to simplify hosting of the user interface.

Angel used to avoid code dependencies and he was always coding his own libraries, even to perform common tasks like using the JSON/RPC interface of an ethereum/rsk node.  
As a TDD evangelist he used to say: "The best mock is the dead mock". He was a big inspiration for a lot of developers' generations, we will always remember his words: "Baby steps, KISS, TDD'' and will miss him.
